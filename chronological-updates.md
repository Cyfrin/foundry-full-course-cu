## Lesson 4 Challenge

We are not going to spoil you the solution of most the challenges but when it is our fault we have to acknowledge it. In this challenge we made a little mistake on the smart contract, in line 40 there is a typo stating `10e10` instead of `1e10` which is the correct value. This is the reason why the challenge is not working as expected.

```solidity
function solveChallenge(uint256 priceGuess, string memory yourTwitterHandle) external {
        uint256 actualPrice = getPrice();
        if (getDecimals() == 8) {
            actualPrice = actualPrice * 10e10; // <======== HERE!
        }
        if (actualPrice + 3e18 > priceGuess && actualPrice - 3e18 < priceGuess) {
            _updateAndRewardSolver(yourTwitterHandle);
        } else {
            revert LessonFour__WrongPrice();
        }
    }
```

So if you use the price feed as normal with 18 decimals and your price feed returns a value like:

```
1572890000000000000000
```

You will need to add one zero to the end of the number to make it work:

```
15728900000000000000000
```

# Lesson 6

1. `forge test -m` has [been replaced](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/98a1862d7e9f6ee53ef7371c683b10f2322ffa23/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L30) by `forge test --mt`
2. If you have trouble installing anvil, you can install it with this command:

```
# install Anvil
cargo install --path ./anvil --profile local --force
```

Per the [foundry docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#building-from-source)

3. The extension used on the video is [Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bungcip.better-toml) which has been deprecated, so please use [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) instead.

# Lesson 7

1. `forge test -m` has [been replaced](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/98a1862d7e9f6ee53ef7371c683b10f2322ffa23/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L30) by `forge test --mt`
2. To run the [foundry-devops](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-devops/) tool, you might need to install [jq](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37668134/how-to-install-jq-on-mac-on-the-command-line)

# Lesson 8

# Lesson 9

The modulo examples shown on remix in the demo are the wrong way around.

It shows on screen (line 11):

```
// 2 % 2 = 0. 2 % 3 = 1.      2 % 6 = 0.  2 % 7 = 1
```

What it should be:

```
// 2 % 2 = 0. 3 % 2 = 1.      6 % 2 = 0.  7 % 2 = 1
```

# Lesson 10

# Lesson 11

On the latest version of Openzeppelin the `_isApprovedOrOwner` and `_exists` are no longer included on [OpenZeppelin ERC721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol) so we have two options:

1. Use the exact same version of OpenZeppelin as the one used on the video: `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.8.0 --no-commit`.

2. Replace the functions for their equivalent on the latest version of OpenZeppelin:

   - for `_isApprovedOrOwner` replace it for: `_isAuthorized`.
   - `_isAuthorized(_ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, tokenId)` is equivalent to `_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId)`.

# Lesson 12

In the latest version of openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts `ERC20Mock.sol` file has been updated with **0** constructor parameters.
You should use `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.8.3 --no-commit` command to download the appropriate version synced with the video.

# Lesson 13

The UUPSUpgradeable function `upgradeTo` has been **removed** in Openzeppelin version 5. You should use `forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable@v4.5.0 --no-commit` command to download the appropriate version synced with the video, or use `upgradeToAndCall(address, new bytes(0))` instead.

# Lesson 14

Openzeppelin v5 made some changes:

1. **Ownable constructor** has been updated with 1 parameter instead of 0. Since `Box.sol` it's inheriting it, we need to pass the address of the owner of the Box contract into its constructor:

```solidity
constructor(address owner) Ownable(owner) {}
```

This will also change the behaviour inside the `GovernorTest.sol`, where we don't need to transfer the contract ownership, but we just set it inside the constructor.

```solidity
contract GovernorTest is Test {
    function setUp() public {
        // controlled.transferOwnership(address(timelock)); deprecated
        controlled = new Controlled(address(timelock));
    }
}
```

2. The role **TIMELOCK_ADMIN_ROLE** has been removed inside `TimelockController.sol`. The admin can be set inside the MyTimelock constructor (1) and then (2) can be revoked after the assignment of the needed roles to MyGovernor.

```solidity
contract MyTimelock is TimelockController {
    constructor(uint256 minDelay, address[] memory proposers, address[] memory executors, address admin)
        TimelockController(minDelay, proposers, executors, admin){}
}
```

```solidity
contract GovernorTest is Test {
    function setUp() public {
        //(1)
        timelock = new Timelock(MIN_DELAY, proposers, executors, address(this));
        //(2)
        bytes32 adminRole = timelock.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE();
        timelock.revokeRole(adminRole, address(this));
    }
}
```

3. Openzeppelin Wizard

- The Openzeppelin Wizard has a totally different content and it misses this import inside `GovToken.sol`:
  `import {Nonces} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Nonces.sol";`
- The voting delay has now changed from 1 block to 7400: this value has to be updated also for the `VOTING_DELAY` state variable inside `GovernorTest.sol`.
