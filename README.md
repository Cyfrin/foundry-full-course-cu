### Questions

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
    - Just know that it will often get things wrong, but it's very fast!
- [Phind](https://www.phind.com/)
    - Like ChatGPT, but it searches the web
- Github Discussions 
    -   Ask questions and chat about the course here!
-   [Stack Exchange Ethereum](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
    -   Great place for asking technical questions about Ethereum

# Lesson 0: Welcome to the Course!
- **Follow the repository:** While going through the course be 100% certain to follow along with the github repository. If you run into in an issue check the chronological-updates in the repo.
- **Be Active in the community:** Ask questions and engage with other developers going through the course in the discussions tab, be sure to go and say hello or gm! This space is different from the other industries, you don't have to be secretive; communicate, network and learn with others :)
- **Learn at your own pace:** It doesn't matter if it takes you a day, a week, a month or even a year. Progress >>> Perfection
- **Take Breaks:** You will exhaust your mind and recall less if you go all out and watch the entire course in one sitting. 
  **Suggested Strategy** every 25 minutes take a 5 min break, and every 2 hours take a longer 30 min break
- **Refer to Documentation:** Things are constantly being updated, so whenever Patrick opens up some documentation, open it your end and maybe even have the code sample next to you.
- **Use ChatGPT and/or the course chat**

# Lesson 1: Blockchain Basics
<same as the 32 hour course, but add in L2s>
<Add PoS>
<add optimistic vs zk L2>
<talk about side chain>

Wallets:
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Frame](https://frame.sh/)

## TODO: Extra credit / Exersizes!
Deploy to L2

# Lesson 5: AI Prompting, Asking Questions, and Getting Help

DO NOT SKIP THIS!!

# Lesson 6: Foundry Simple Storage

💻 Code: [https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/foundry-simple-storage-f23](https://github.com/ChainAccelOrg/foundry-simple-storage-f23)

## Installation & Setup (MacOS & Linux)
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo)
- [VSCode Keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [What is a terminal?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)

### Windows Setup
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  - When working in WSL, use Linux commands instead of Windows commands
- [TroubleShooting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting)
- `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`

> ⚠️ Please use Gitpod as an absolute last resort
### Gitpod
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  - **If using this, NEVER share a private key with real money on Gitpod**
  - Ideally you figure out the MacOS, Linux, or Windows install though

## Local Development Introduction
- `CMD + K` or `CTRL + K` clears the terminal
- `mkdir ethers-simple-storage-fcc`
- `code .` to open VSCode in a new VSCode window

Also do advanced stuff like:
cast
anvil
tests

- Format your solidity code with: 
```json
    "[solidity]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity"
    },
    "[javascript]":{
      "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
    }
```
[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
[ETH JSON RPC](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)

2 Ways to deploy:
1. `forge create`
2. `forge script`

```bash
cast --to-base 0x01 dec
```
